## Introduction

This is E-learning application use for online learning and teach online to user as well .

## Getting started

This is a basic API skeleton written in JavaScript. Very useful to building a RESTful web APIs for your front-end platforms.

This project will run on **NodeJs** using **MongoDB** as database. I had tried to maintain the code structure easy as any beginner can also adopt the flow and start building an API. Project is open for suggestions, Bug reports and pull requests.

## Features

- Basic Authentication (Register/Login with hashed password)
- Email helper ready just import and use.
- JWT Tokens, make requests with a token after login with `Authorization` header with value `Bearer yourToken` where `yourToken` will be returned in Login response.
- Pre-defined response structures with proper status codes.
- Included CORS.
- **Book** example with **CRUD** operations.
- Validations added.
- Included API collection for Postman.
- Light-weight project.

## Software Requirements

- Node.js **8+**
- MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)

## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "E-learning" to your project name.

```bash
git clone
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompressed to your desired directory

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd E-learning
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.

## How to run

### Running API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```

**Note:** `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/routes/` and add it in `/routes/api.js` it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers

If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file in `/controllers/` and use them in the routes.
